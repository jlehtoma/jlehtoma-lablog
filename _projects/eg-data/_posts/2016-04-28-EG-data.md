## Creating metadata

Metadata creation for the datasets included in the PROVIDE collection (PGs) has been started using two data sources:

  1. [EG-dmp Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MmWfJWktF33SMscCfUzE-GhYj1X0M4HB3FOF9IbHPjk/edit?usp=sharing)
  2. Metadata extracted from the geospatial rasters themselves.

Metdata creation is introduced as [a new rule](https://github.com/VUEG/data-EG/blob/master/pg_mapping/Snakefile#L70) in the Snakemake rule set for the PROVIDE data. As a result of the Snakemake rule set, each dataset is placed into a subfolder with associated `datapackage.json` file. For a more thorough description on the planned metadata spec, see [the planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14hkCdIkAXta3aErwbGGnEMtBLuNlerMqCg5-JtIOU94/edit?usp=sharing).

Technically, the metadata creation is handled through two Python packages:

  1. [`egpackager`](https://github.com/VUEG/egpackager): Connects to various data sources (Google spreadsheet and rasters metadata implemented so far) and aggregates the metadata from different source.
  2. A patched version of the [`datapackage`](https://github.com/VUEG/datapackage) package. This forked version must be used to allow for using raster metadata.

## Uploading data on BeeHub

All the PROVIDE datasets and the European wood production datasets have been manually uploaded to BeeHub using `cadaver`. There is no automated process for the uploading yet.
