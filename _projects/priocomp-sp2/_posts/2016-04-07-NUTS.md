## About NUTS

Source: [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview)

+ The current NUTS 2013 classification is valid from 1 January 2015 and lists 98 regions at NUTS 1, 276 regions at NUTS 2 and 1342 regions at NUTS 3 level.
+ The NUTS classification (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU for the purpose of:
  - The collection, development and harmonisation of European regional statistics
  - Socio-economic analyses of the regions
    * NUTS 0: Countries
    * NUTS 1: major socio-economic regions
    * NUTS 2: basic regions for the application of regional policies
    * NUTS 3: small regions for specific diagnoses

## Processing NUTS data

+ Data downloaded and organized by rule [`get_data`](https://github.com/VUEG/data-eurostat/blob/master/NUTS/Snakefile#L24).
+ Rule [`separate_levels`](https://github.com/VUEG/data-eurostat/blob/master/NUTS/Snakefile#L47) separates file `NUTS_RG_01M_2013.shp` into level 0 and 2 shapefiles in subfolders.
+ *Optional:* Create a new rule [`import_to_postgis`](https://github.com/VUEG/data-eurostat/blob/master/NUTS/Snakefile#L21) for importing NUTS data to postgis.
